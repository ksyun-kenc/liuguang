# Regame - Cloud Gaming Engine

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md) | English

`Regame - Cloud Gaming Engine` is a set of technologies developed by Edge computing team of [Ksyun](https://www.ksyun.com/) to serve the cloud game scene.

Cloud gaming is a method of playing video games that is done using remote hardware. You don't have to download or install games locally, just begin playing the game immediately because it is being run on remote servers. 

Cloud gaming engine is a core technology to host ordinary games on remote server and start cloud gaming service.

`Regame` is still under development. It would be great if you could help.

## 4. Setting Up Your Build Environment

### 4.1 VS2019

Install VS2019 with ATL, CLang.

[CLang/LLVM x64](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/download/llvmorg-11.0.0/LLVM-11.0.0-win64.exe) is also needed, while VS may only has CLang x86.

### 4.2 Boost

Install [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) and set `BOOST_ROOT` environment variable to install directory. [Details](https://blog.umu618.com/2020/09/11/umutech-boost-1-installation/)

Boost compile command:

```
# For MTRelease configuration
.\b2 --address-model=64 runtime-link=static
```

### 4.3 FFmpeg

Set `FFMPEG_ROOT` environment variable to the path of your [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) directory. [LGPL shared is recommended.](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases)

The folder tree should be like:

```
├─bin
├─include
│  ├─libavcodec
│  ├─libavdevice
│  ├─libavfilter
│  ├─libavformat
│  ├─libavutil
│  ├─libpostproc
│  ├─libswresample
│  └─libswscale
└─lib
    ├─x64
    └─x86
```

### 4.4 SDL

Set `SDL2_ROOT` environment variable to the path of your [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) directory. eg:

The same as [SDL_ttf 2.0](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/) and [SDL_net 2.0](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/).

The folder tree should be like:

```
├─bin
├─include
│  └─SDL2
└─lib
    ├─x64
    └─x86
```

### 4.5 WDK

Required by cgvhid, cgvidd.

## 5. Building and Testing

```
git clone https://github.com/ksyun-kenc/liuguang
cd liuguang
git submodule update --init
```

Open each solution file with VS, prefer to select MTRelease configuration, then build.

Test steps:

- Run `cge` on server.

- Run `video_source` on server.

- Run `cgc --server=<server_address>` on anther PC as long as it can access the server over the network.

Test with games:

Assume you want to test USF4.

- Install `cgvhid` on server. [Details](src/cgvhid/cgvhid/)

- If you prefer gamepad to keyboard, install `ViGEmBus` on server. [Download](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases)

- Run `cge --keyboard-replay=cgvhid --gamepad-replay=vigem` on server.

- Run `cgi -d true -e SSFIV.exe -i SSFIV.exe --lx86 .\captureyuv.dll` on server.

- Run `cgc --server=<server_address>` on anther PC as long as it can access the server over the network.

**Note** that only support D3D9, D3D11, D3D12 games now.
